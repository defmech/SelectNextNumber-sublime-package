SelectNextNumber-sublime-package
================================

A SublimeText 3 package for selecting the next number.

When dealing with the following code: new createjs.Rectangle(770, 241, 107, 88) it would be great to be able to “tab” from one number to the next. e.g. With 770 selected I type new value over it and hit "ctrl+Tab” to jump and select 241 ready for typing over.
