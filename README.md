SelectNextNumber-sublime-package
================================

A SublimeText 3 package for selecting the next number.

When dealing with the following code: new createjs.Rectangle(770, 241, 107, 88) you can use “ctrl+Tab” to jump from one number to the next. e.g. With 770 selected, I can type new value over it, then hit “ctrl+Tab” to jump and select 241 ready for typing over.
